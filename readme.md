## Wally's Widgets - Test

-   Used to calculate what size packs need to be sent to customer in order to fulfil the order without sending too many widgets or not enough widgets

## Deployment bug (Production mode only)

-   Vite build process will sometimes place the main.css/js manifest setup in the wrong order
-   Simply re-order the two and the js/css will load correctly
